# JavaliCompiler
Compiler from the course Compiler Design at ETH ZÃ¼rich. Parses and compiles a subset of Java to x86 assembly. This subset includes, for example:

* Classes (incl. inheritance and polymorphism)
* While loops.
* Primitive types: integers, floating point numbers, and booleans.
* Arrays (non-variant).
* Built-in functions: read() and write() for integers and floats.
* Casts.

Developed by Johannes Keinestam, Roger Schmid and Anton Jakobsson. 

Some skeleton code was provided by the TAs of the course.
