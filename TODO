- Complete constant folding -- partial constant folding
	-Add flag -once, if once is not set, run constant folding multiple times(hardcoded?/until convergence?)

- Testing for constant folding (done)
- Testing dead assignment elimination (done)
We can always add more testcases

- Check correctness of test cases one more time

- Constant folding for null constants? 

- Dead assignments in if(false){//operations on variable => not dead}
